Story:

BE THE MIGHY SAVIOR OF THE GALAXIES!!

You are the only surviving argonian of the galaxy from the planet argonia who has to beat the evil galaxy warlords to establish a fair economy in the world.
It is a grid based game in which you need to get your moves aligned accordingly to beat them somehow because the faith of the galaxy resides on you!! XO

TLDR and rulebook:

This is a classic tic tac toe version of the game created in python using pygame (contains a UI as well).

It begins by asking the user whether they want to go first or not. Depending on what the user chooses, the AI of the game either begins the game if the user chose no or the it waits for the user to begin using their turn.

What user needs to do is to click inside one of the squares inside the display grid to change the color of the grid and then they should see the color of the grid they chose change and then the AI would make its move and wait for the user to make their move. The game would end when either the user gets all 3 squares in a row, column or diagonal of the same color or either the AI gets them same first.
